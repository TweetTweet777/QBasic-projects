Modify the EQUAL flowchart so that it reads THREE numbers.  The flowchart (and the program) must compare all 3 numbers to each other and store the largest number in a variable named BIGGEST% and the smallest of the 3 numbers in a variable named SMALLEST%.  
(Hint:  you will need at least 2 questions (Selection (Decision) Structures)…you may have more than 2.)  
(Possible Hint:  you may choose to create an additional new variable or two to accomplish this task.  It is not necessary, but you may choose to do so.)
Both the largest and the smallest number are to be output.  
If ALL 3 numbers are equal, print a message stating “ALL NUMBERS ARE EQUAL”.

Modify the EQUAL code so that it stores the largest of the 3 numbers in a variable named BIGGEST% and the smallest of the 3 numbers in a variable named SMALLEST%.
Modify the output to be in columns, with column headings explaining what the value underneath the heading is.  E.g. column headings of “SMALLEST” with “NUMBER” on the line below, etc.   Both the largest value and the smallest value are to be printed in the output.
