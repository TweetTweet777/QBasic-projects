A teacher needs a program that will read a student’s name , 3 test scores and number of credits.  
The program needs to calculate the average of these test scores.  
The program then needs to determine if the student has PASSED or FAILED based on the following criteria:  
the student’s average must be 70 or above to pass the course
the student must have 18 or more credits to pass the course
The program must then print the student’s name, the average, the number of credits and a message stating either “Pass” or “Fail” (based on the criteria noted above).

Use the following sets of test data:

Student Name			Test 1	Test 2	Test 3	Credits
David Bowie			   80		   55		   75		    17
Smoky Robinson		 45		   90		   78	   	  18
Jimmy Barnes			 87		   35		   85		    19

PLUS:  Create a few more sets of test data that you will use to test the program.

NOTE:  Notice that the credit numbers (highlighted in yellow) are BOUNDARY CASES for the credit number criteria (right below 18, right on 18 and right above 18).  One of the requirements for MERIT in your NCEA assessments is to cover ALL possible boundary cases in your test data!

USE AT LEAST 4 SUBROUTINES, A MINIMUM OF:
Reading the data
Calculating the average
Determining the “PASS” or “FAIL” status
Displaying the output

Output Formatting:
The main title on the output is to be “Year 11 Programming”
The subtitle on the output is to be “Term 1 Final Mark”
The detail line of the report are to have the following column headings:  “Student”, “Term 1 Average”, “Credits” and “Term 1 Status”
Embellish the output appropriately.
